# UFOs

### Purpose and Technologies

The purpose of this weekâ€™s assignment was to take a large amount of data and put in into a visual that was easy to understand and comprehend. Using the filters function allows the user to gather specific information based on their interests of UFOs sightings. By adding the additional filters from the challenge, the webpage became more typical of the capabilites of current websites today. The technologies used were JavaScript, ES, JavaScript functions, HTML and Bootstrap to create a customized webpage to filter through the data located in an array. 

### Further Exploration
To further enhance the webpage, I would like to include links for more information per sighting scraping articles from the internet. I would include photos (if available) of any UFO sightings for an enhanced visual.
